### Running the Application
- In PyCharm, create a run configuration with the `main.py` file path
- Find the executable for ngrok which you installed, and expose your SNS port using ngrok e.g. `/path/to/ngrok http 5000`
  - ngrok will give you a HTTPS forwarding endpoint e.g. `Forwarding https://92955034edb1.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000`
  - Your webhook will therefore be registered at that ngrok endpoint + route you have setup e.g. `https://<YOUR_NGROK_FORWARDING_SUBDOMAIN>.ngrok.io/telegram/webhook`

- Link your Telegram bot to your webhook
  - Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows)
  - Paste the following snippet, replacing the `<API_TOKEN>` with the saved API token for your Telegram bot, and `<WEBHOOK_URL>` with the ngrok url with route that you've configured in the previous step.
  - You should receive the following response `{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}`

```
curl -L -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<API_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<WEBHOOK_URL>"

e.g.
curl -L -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot1234567890:AAG2g-bIHq4_JDWSINaOrhDw1gf5L7rzniM/setWebhook?url=https://d6e3134b7be7.ngrok.io/telegram/webhook"
```

  - Test that your endpoint is returning a valid response for the webhook with the following 
```
curl -L -X POST "https://d6e3134b7be7.ngrok.io/telegram/webhook"
```
